;; original "naive" implementation
;; * simply hash the word

;; It was pretty quickly obvious that hashing means rainbow tables up
;; the ass, which explains the PIk() stuff in the paper. So now, your
;; "hash" will simply be keyword encryption, may refine later.
;;
;; As you were writing the below, you realized that "apply merge"
;; wouldn't jive with a bunch of identical encrypted words (plus
;; frequency analysis vulnerability), so the "j" was added.

;; Possible
