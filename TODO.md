Yay stuff is happening. You're still very wedded to that paper, but you *think* you have a pretty good idea

Generate a "reverse-lookup" (if that's what it's even called) table: word -> texts
Encrypt all the texts with a key
Somehow associated texts with a hash/other kind of encryption
Create lookup table hash/otherthing word + j -> hash thing from above^

Still not clear on how trapdoor/search works based on this^. Review in morning
